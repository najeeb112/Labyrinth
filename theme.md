# Website Theme

The theme of the website is developed after a lot of discussion among our teams. To develop the theme is a difficult task.

You have to choose a suitable Color Palletes for your website such as:

-    Background Colors
-    Navbar colors
-    Footer Colors
-    Diagrams Colors
-    Icons Colors

We have used background Colors #fefefe and Dark Blue is our Main Color.

the Fonts we used for The Website are:

-    Frank Libre Font
-    Roboto

The fonts for the Heading and Titles are different as compared to font of the common text. That's it.
