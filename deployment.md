# Workflow and deployment

After installation of the WordPress CMS, we first developed the pages for our websites. After developing the pages, we go to the menu setting.

The thing to be noted, the number of pages and menu depends upon the type of the website you want to create. As our topic is to create a consultation website, so after this point we installed relevent Plugins such [ELementor](https://elementor.com/) and [All to One WP migration](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/all-in-one-wp-migration.7.63.zip)

After activating the plugins, we moved to the customization of our theme. So to develop a good and professionanl theme. We need a large amount of suitable data that related to the immigration business.

The development of the Theme includes different kinds of languages that includes Front-End Such as Html, CSS, and JavaScript and Back-End Languages like PHP.

The final step after creating the webite is to deployment of the website by buying a suitable domain and hosting. Any new member can edit, update, add and delete pages, posts, and menus from the WordPress terminals.
